# Sumé LMS public roadmap

:stars: View the [official Sumé LMS public product roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/sumelms/projects/4/views/1)

Our product roadmap is where you can learn about what features we're working on, what stage they're in, and when we expect to bring them to you.

The roadmap repository is for communicating Sumé LMS’ roadmap. Existing issues are currently read-only, and we are locking conversations, as we get started.

Have any questions or comments about items on the roadmap? Share your feedback via [public discussions](https://github.com/orgs/sumelms/discussions).


## Guide to the roadmap

Every item on the roadmap is an issue, with a label that indicates each of the following:

- A **release phase** that describes the next expected phase of the roadmap item. See below for a guide to release phases.

- A **feature area** that indicates the area of the product to which the item belongs. For a list of current product areas, see below.

- A **feature targets** that indicates the main user target of the product to which the item belongs. For a list of current product targets, see below.

- Once a feature is delivered, the **shipped** label will be applied to the roadmap issue and the issue will be closed with a comment linking to the relevant [Changelog](https://sumelms.com/changelog).

## Release phases

Release phases indicate the stages that the product or feature goes through, from early testing to general availability.

- **alpha**: _Primarily for testing and feedback._ \
Limited availability, requires pre-release agreement. Features still under heavy development, and subject to change. Not for production use, and no documentation, SLAs or support provided.

- **beta**: _Publicly available in full or limited capacity._ \
Features mostly complete and documented. Timeline and requirements for GA usually published. No SLAs or support provided.

- **ga**: _Generally available to all customers._ \
Ready for production use with associated SLA and technical support obligations. Approximately 1-2 quarters from Beta.

Some of our features may still be in the exploratory stages, and have no timeframe available. These are included in the roadmap only for early feedback. These are marked as follows:

- **in design**: _Feature in discovery phase._ \
We have decided to build this feature, but are still figuring out how.

- **exploring**: _Feature under consideration._ \
We are considering building this feature, and gathering feedback on it.

## Roadmap stages

The roadmap is arranged on a project board to give a sense for how far out each item is on the horizon. Every product or feature is added to a particular project board column according to the quarter in which it is expected to ship next. Be sure to read the disclaimer below since the roadmap is subject to change, especially further out on the timeline. You'll also find an Exploratory column, which is used in conjunction with the in design and exploring release phase labels for when no timeframe is yet available.
